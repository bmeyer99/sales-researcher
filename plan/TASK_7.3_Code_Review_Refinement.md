# Task 7.3: Code Review & Refinement

**Phase:** Phase 7: Documentation & Review
**Parent Plan:** [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md)
**Status:** To Do
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-29

## 1. Description
Perform a comprehensive code review of the entire codebase (frontend, backend, Docker configurations). This task aims to ensure code quality, adherence to best practices, security, efficiency, and maintainability. It's an iterative process that should ideally happen throughout development but is formalized here as a final step before considering the project "complete" for this scope.

## 2. Detailed Steps / Implementation Notes

1.  **Code Style and Linting:**
    *   **Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript):**
        *   Ensure ESLint and Prettier are configured and used.
        *   Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` (or equivalent yarn/pnpm commands) in the `frontend` directory.
        *   Address all warnings and errors.
    *   **Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
        *   Use a linter like Flake8 or Pylint.
        *   Use a code formatter like Black or Ruff.
        *   Run `flake8 backend/` or `black backend/` (or `ruff check backend/ --fix`).
        *   Address all warnings and errors.

2.  **Security Review:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Verify that all sensitive information (API keys, client secrets, refresh tokens) are loaded from environment variables and never hardcoded or committed to the repository.
    *   **OAuth Token Handling:** Review the secure storage of refresh tokens on the backend. Ensure access tokens are not exposed to the frontend unnecessarily.
    *   **Input Validation:** Confirm that all user inputs (e.g., company name, folder name) are properly validated on the backend to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    *   **CORS:** Ensure CORS settings are correctly configured for production (allowing only trusted origins).
    *   **Dependencies:** Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies using tools like `npm audit` (for Node.js) and `pip-audit` or `safety` (for Python).

3.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Review all `try-except` blocks to ensure errors are caught, logged appropriately (without exposing sensitive data), and handled gracefully.
    *   Ensure user-facing error messages are clear and informative (Task 5.6).
    *   Implement robust logging for debugging and monitoring.

4.  **Performance and Efficiency:**
    *   **Database Queries:** If a database is introduced later, review query efficiency.
    *   **API Calls:** Optimize external API calls (Gemini, Google Drive) to minimize unnecessary requests. Implement caching where appropriate (though minimal caching is a goal for this project).
    *   **Celery Tasks:** Ensure tasks are efficient and don't block the worker for too long. Review task concurrency settings.
    *   **Docker Images:** Confirm that Docker images are as small as possible and use multi-stage builds effectively.

5.  **Maintainability and Readability:**
    *   **Code Structure:** Ensure logical separation of concerns (e.g., services, tasks, API endpoints).
    *   **Naming Conventions:** Consistent and descriptive naming for variables, functions, classes, and files.
    *   **Comments and Docstrings:** Add comments for complex logic and docstrings for functions/classes.
    *   **Modularity:** Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones.

6.  **Completeness and Functionality:**
    *   Verify that all features outlined in the `PROJECT_PLAN.md` have been implemented and tested.
    *   Perform end-to-end testing of the entire workflow.

7.  **Testing (Unit/Integration - Optional but Recommended):**
    *   While not explicitly a task, consider adding unit tests for critical functions (e.g., `gemini_service`, `google_drive_service`, `content_extraction_service`).
    *   Integration tests for API endpoints and Celery task flows.

## 3. Expected Output / Deliverables
*   A codebase that adheres to high quality standards, is secure, efficient, and maintainable.
*   All linting and formatting issues resolved.
*   Identified and addressed security vulnerabilities.

## 4. Dependencies
*   All previous implementation tasks.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
*   No linting or formatting errors when running respective tools.
*   No critical security vulnerabilities reported by dependency scanners.
*   All major error paths are handled gracefully.
*   The application functions as expected end-to-end.

## 6. Estimated Effort (Optional)
*   Large (This is an ongoing process throughout development, but a final dedicated review is crucial).

## 7. Notes / Questions
*   **Automate Where Possible:** Integrate linting, formatting, and security checks into CI/CD pipelines if available.
*   **Peer Review:** Ideally, code review is a collaborative process involving other developers.
*   **Iterative Process:** Code refinement is not a one-time event but an ongoing practice.
