# This is an example .env file for Docker Compose variables at the project root.
# Copy this to .env and fill in your actual values.

# Redis Password (used directly by docker-compose.yml for the redis service)
REDIS_PASSWORD="your_strong_redis_password_here"

# Other project-level variables that might be directly interpolated 
# in docker-compose.yml can be added here.
# For example, if you wanted to parameterize external ports (though not recommended for this project):
# HOST_FRONTEND_PORT=3000
# HOST_BACKEND_PORT=8000
